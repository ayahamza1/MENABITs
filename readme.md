## Formatting

All treaty formatting has been standardized to ease readability and interpretation. Some grammatical errors (e.g., subject-verb disagreement) remain from their original texts to preserve integrity.

---

## BIT Transparency

This index has yet to identify the following BITs:
* Egypt - Saudi Arabia (2024)
* Egypt – Serbia (1977)
* Burundi – Egypt (2012)

---

## BIT Text Retrieval

The `PyPDF2`, `pdfminer.six`, `pdfplumber`, and `PyMuPDF` Python packages were used to scrape texts from UNCTAD or other available English PDFs. The extractions were cleaned, missing data inputted, and visually cross-referenced with originals.

## Recommendations

Researchers should review each text file closely. For example, the U.S. treaty text includes duplicated language in its protocol and annexes. Be attentive to avoid misinterpretation when analyzing provisions.

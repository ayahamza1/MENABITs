## Formatting

All treaty formatting has been standardized (e.g., bulleting, headings, capitalization) to ease readability and interpretation. Some grammatical errors (e.g., subject-verb disagreement) remain from their original texts to preserve integrity.

## BIT Transparency

This index has yet to identify the following BITs:
* Egypt - Saudi Arabia BIT (2024)
* Burundi – Egypt BIT (2012)
* Egypt – Serbia BIT (1977)

## BIT Text Retrieval

The `PyPDF2`, `pdfminer.six`, `pdfplumber`, and `PyMuPDF` Python packages were used to scrape texts from the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development [(UNCTAD)](https://investmentpolicy.unctad.org/international-investment-agreements/countries/62/egypt)
, if unavailable, English PDFs available elsewhere (locations included below). The extractions were cleaned, missing data inputted, and visually cross-referenced with originals.

## Recommendations

Researchers should review each text file closely. For example, the U.S. treaty text includes duplicated language in its protocol and annexes. Be attentive to avoid misinterpretation when analyzing provisions.

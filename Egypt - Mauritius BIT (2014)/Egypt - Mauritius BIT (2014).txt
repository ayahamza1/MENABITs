ARTICLE 7 
EXPROPRIATION 
 
1. Investments of an investor of either Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party shall not be subjected to nationalization or expropriation or subjected to any measure having an effect equivalent to nationalization or expropriation unless the measures are taken on a non-discriminatory basis, for public purpose, in accordance with due process of law and against payment of compensation in accordance with this Article.

The Contracting Party making the expropriation shall make every endeavor to ensure that such review is carried out promptly. 
 
7. Where a Contracting Party expropriates the assets of a legal entity which is incorporated or constituted under the law in force in any part of its own territory, and in which investors of the other Contracting Party own shares, it shall, to the extent necessary and subject to its laws, ensure that compensation according to this Article will be made available to such investors.

The application of safeguard measures may be extended through their formal reintroduction.

7. Unless the disputing parties agree otherwise, the arbitral tribunal shall comprise three arbitrators, one arbitrator appointed by each of the disputing parties and the third, who shall be the Chairman, appointed by agreement of the disputing parties.

The subrogated rights or claims shall not exceed the original rights or claims of the investor. 
 
2. Any payment made by one Contracting Party or its designated Agency to its investor as provided in paragraph (1) shall not affect the right of such investor to make his claims against the other Contracting Party in accordance with Article 10 provided that the exercise of such a right does not overlap, or is not in conflict with, the exercise of a right in virtue of subrogation under that paragraph.
